- openai package
- streamlit package

## Clone the repository

- Tap on API
- Give details

#### Note:  OpenAI API key is sensitive information, and you must treat it as a secret to avoid unauthorized use. If someone else gets access to your API key, they could misuse it, leading to unexpected costs or violations of the OpenAI terms of service.

## To make the api secret key safe
### Step 1:
```
cd Financial-Data-Extraction
```
create a file name .env, then insert it
```
OPENAI_API_KEY = your_api_key
```
Then, Save it
### Step2:
Create .gitignore file and then just add
```
.env
```
Save it

Now the secret key is safe, No one to see when you make it public repo

## Use the .env File in Your Code
- In Python, install the python-dotenv library:
```
pip install python-dotenv
```
- Update your code to load the environment variable from the .env file:
```
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

# Load variables from .env
load_dotenv()

# Access the OpenAI API key
api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```
Now the api key is ready!

## Usage
